PROBLEM:
    Manually testing a lot of different reports. With different data, with different shapes, with different requirements...

SOLUTION:
    The script, which after running will test a report

The project consists of 2 files: config.py and auto_testing.py
In config.py should add names of fields which tested depending on kind of test.
